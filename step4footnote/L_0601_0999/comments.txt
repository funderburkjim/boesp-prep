<..yAvat tatsarvamitTaMmayaM prakArako..>
Here I have doubt about the word in the middle <tatsarvamitTaMmayaM>
This is broken in two words in the scan with a - such as <tatsarvamitTaM> and <mayaM>
In scan it appears as one word. How do you think this should be written?
JIM:  No change needed: Digitize as one word tatsarvamitTaMmayaM

The entry is correct according to scan but I think the word should be
<s>gatAsUrnagatAsUnSca</s>
JIM: not sure.  putting in open questions
